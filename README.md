#Powerset/BA Visualization
The motivation for this image was to represent a powerset as the adjacency matrix for a 
DAG representing a Boolean poset (Hasse diagram). After creating the image 
I found that it resembles certain cellular automata (126, 102), although I have not studied
the latter enough to construct an isomorphism.
