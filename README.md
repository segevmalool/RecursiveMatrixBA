#Powerset/BA Visualization
The motivation for this image was to represent a powerset as the adjacency matrix for a 
directed acyclic graph representing a Boolean poset (i.e. a Hasse diagram). After creating the image 
I found that it resembles certain cellular automata (126, 102), although I have not studied
the latter enough to construct an isomorphism.

### Some Preliminaries

A partially ordered set is a pair (S,R) where S is a set with n elements and R is a reflexive (or irreflexive for a strict ordering), antisymmetric (
